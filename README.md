## Overview
This repo is for the implementation of the requirements and software of the game of Bingo.

## The Game
Two players are presented with a 5x5 board that has to be filled in with letters or numbers based on the game mode. The players can choose if they would like the computer to fill out a random board for them or they can fill out the board on their own. The user clicks a button to choose a random letter/number. Each player checks if their board contains the chosen letter/number. The boxes containing that letter/number will have their back color changed to green. The first player to fill a winning set, defined as a row, column, or diagonal line of five boxes with a back color of green wins.
